## Overview

MLLM-Motion is a multimodal large language model that can generate and understand various forms of media including images, videos, and audio. It's built on top of the NextGPT architecture and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.

## Features ✨

- **Multimodal Understanding**: Process and understand text, images, videos, and audio
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly Gradio-based web interface
- **Flexible Generation**: Generate various types of media based on user prompts
- **Advanced Architecture**: Built on state-of-the-art transformer models
- **Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune generation parameters for optimal results

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MLLM-Motion.git
cd MLLM-Motion
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the model checkpoints and place them in the appropriate directory.

## Usage 🚀

1. Start the demo application:

```bash
python code/demo_app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL.

3. Interact with the model through the web interface:

## Model Architecture 🧠

The model is based on the NextGPT architecture with the following key components:

- Transformer-based language model
- Multimodal encoders for different media types
- Custom diffusion models for generation
- Q-Former for cross-modal understanding
